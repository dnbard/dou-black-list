### Features include:

- a _very_ convenient button next to the username
- implemented failsafe, so you don't ban someone by accident!
- persistent between reloads, different topics, and threads
- works for collapsed threads
- ban / unban capability
- hides all messages from banned users with an ability to unhide by clicking each of them temporarily (sometimes you just want to see who you banned and pat yourself on the shoulder)
#### and much more to come!
